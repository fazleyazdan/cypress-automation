#### **Assertions :** assertion are validation points

For e.g. we can validate whether this element contain this text or 
The title of the web page etc.

We can use multiple assertion in cypress and basically these assertions comes from
The **chai** library.

**There two types of assertions :**

1) **Implicit assertions**  (built-in/default in cypress)
   Under the implicit assertion we will mainly use
	 a. Should
	 b. And
	
2) **Explicit assertions**  (which we need to write explicitly)
   Under the explicit assertion we will mainly use
	 a. Expect (mainly use in Tdd approach)
	 b. Assert  (Bdd approach)
	
*All assertion comes from **chai** library.*
