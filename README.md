## This project contains best practices for automating web apps with cypress.

### Here i wrote scripts for automating web apps which will give beginners an idea and understanding of automating web apps with cypress.

### testsuit --> testcase --> test steps

### specfile(cy.js) --> describe(testsuit) --> it(testcase) -->  


### Cypress : Frontend web Automation Tools. 
###	          Used for modern web application
###	          Open Source Software Except (Dashboard)
	
	
**Traditional web apps** : html, CSS, JS etc.
**Modern Web apps** : React , Node, Angular etc.

*Through cypress we can automate any application which runs on browser*

**Language** : JS is used in Cypress

**Environment** : Node.js
*Cypress built on node JS env*

**Example** : if you want to run any java you need JRE
#### Similarly to run cypress you need to setup Node.js Env
#### It comes with NPM module. We will install libraries from npm

**Who can use Cypress** : 
--> to automate End-to-End(E2E) test cases
--> Integration Tests
--> Unit Test cases 
--> API Testing

**So the answer is both Dev and QA people can also use it**


**Cypress VS Selenium:**

**Cypress Eco System:**

	1. Test Runner (Free) : Open Source Locally Installed (used for setting and       running Test cases scripts)
	
	2. Dashboard  (Paid) : used for test reporting and maintaining test history
	

**Features:**
	1. Time Travel : You can go back to previous steps as well as next steps. 
	2. Screenshot & video : Cypress will capture screenshot for every statement
	For example : there are 10 lines of code. For every line of execution 
	Cypress will capture the screenshot. But the main thing is maintaining the 
	History.
	3. Debuggability : Debugging is easy
	4. Built in wait : Hence no synchronization error. (No Explicit or implicit wait)
	5. Consistent results 
	6. Cross Browser Testing 

**Limitations :**
	1. We can't automate window or mobile based apps
	2. Limited support
	3. Only support JS and TypeScript 
	4. Reading from and writing data into external file is little bit tricky.
	5. Third party reporting tools integration is also difficult
